          <h3 class="h3-title"><u>The National Tragedy</u></h3>
            <p class="one"> At 8:45 a.m. on September 11, 2001, an American Airlines Boeing 767, Flight 11, 
                collided into the World Trade Center’s north tower in New York City immediately 
                killing hundreds of people and trapping hundreds more in the 110-story skyscraper. 
                Only 18 minutes later, a second Boeing 767, United Airlines Flight 175, flew into
                the south tower. Both towers afire, burning debris covered the surrounding buildings 
                and the streets below while hundreds jumped from the towers to their deaths in an 
                attempt to escape. About 30 minutes later, a third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, 
                crashed into the west side of the Pentagon near Washington, D.C. and a fourth plane, 
                United Flight 93, crash-landed into a field in Pennsylvania killing all 40 souls on board. 
                Meanwhile, both World Trade Center towers collapsed into a terrifying and deadly inferno 
                of rubble. </p>
          <h3 class="h3-title"><u>The Victims</u></h3>       
            <p class="one">
                At the hands of 19 militant terrorists associated with the Islamic extremist group al-Qaeda
                headed by Osama bin Laden, more than 3,000 people (including more than 400 police officers
                and firefighters) were killed and more than 10,000 others were wounded during the attacks
                on 9/11. It was the deadliest terrorist act in U.S. history and the most devastating 
                foreign attack on American soil since the attack on Pearl Harbor.

            <p class="one">
                    September 11th is now known as "Patriot Day” in the United States and is observed 
                    as
                    the National Day of Service and Remembrance of the victims of the 9/11 attacks. Across 
                    the country, numerous events are held on this day to honor the loss of thousands of lives.
                    There are also three somber
                    and beautiful memorial sites dedicated to remembering the victims of 9/11:</p>

                    The Flight 93 National Memorial is located at the site of the crash of United Airlines 
                    Flight 93 about 2 miles north of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The memorial honors the 40 
                    passengers and crew who died on 9/11. It features concrete walls outlining the Flight
                    Path Walkway and a white marble Wall of Names. There are also plans to construct a 
                    93-foot tower to designate the entrance of the Flight 93 National Memorial which will
                    contain 40 wind chimes — one for each passenger and crew member who died.

                    The National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial located in Arlington, Virginia, honors the loss of 184
                    people who died on September 11, 2001. Each victim’s age and location at the time of the
                    attack are inscribed into the Memorial starting from the youngest victim, three-year-old
                    Dana Falkenberg, to the oldest, John D. Yamnicky, 71, a Navy veteran, both of whom were
                    aboard American Airlines Flight 77 that morning.

                    The National September 11 Memorial & Museum, a nonprofit in New York City, remembers and
                    honors the 2,983 people killed in the horrific attacks as well as hundreds more who 
                    risked their lives to save others and all who demonstrated extraordinary compassion in 
                    the aftermath of the attacks. It is located at the epicenter of Ground Zero at the World
                    Trade Center site. The names of every person who died in the terrorist attacks are 
                    inscribed in bronze panels around two enormous memorial pools with waterfalls that
                    stand in the footprints of where the twin towers once stood. A Callery pear tree 
                    that miraculously survived within the rubble of Ground Zero, now known as the
                    "Survivor Tree," stands tall and thriving nearby. A symbol of strength and resilience
                    here and elsewhere, each year, the 9/11 Memorial gives seedlings from the Survivor Tree
                    to communities that have endured tragedy.<br> <br>

                            The University of California at Davis study, based on 8,000 air samples, collected
                            from the rooftop at 201 Varick St. in Manhattan, showed that the smoke and dust cloud
